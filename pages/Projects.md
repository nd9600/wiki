* Social network that's like real life - you can only send messages to specific pre-specified groups of people who have either allowed you to send them to you/allowed anyone to send to them (/in a particular time range), host time limited groups that anyone can join but get deleted after a time, or sticky 1 or 2 messages.

* https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-event-stream-incident-45653ecbda99 - restricting access to IO/etc., or executing HTTP/DB requests against an interface/stream, or deciding to hit the DB, and then you have to pass that decision off to somewhere else, which actually does it
