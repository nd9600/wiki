[D3](https://d3js.org/) is a data visualisation library for HTML, SVGs, and CSS.

Generally, it works by:
1. [Selecting](#selections) DOM elements
2. [Joining data](#data_joins) to those elements
3. [Adding/removing](#enterexit) elements from the page to match the data you've joined with
4. [Transforming](#transformations) the elements

Along with that, D3 also includes functions that let you easily
* [Scale](#scaling_inputs) input values to match some scale, useful when making axes
* [Make shapes](#making_shapes)
* [Layout data](#layouts) in more complicated ways
* [Interact](#interactions) with your data or elements

<sub>everything here will call functions like `d3.select()`, not `select()`</sub>

# API reference
[Here](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md)

Normally (but not always), D3's methods return DOM elements, so you can chain them together:
```
d3.select("#treeSvg g.tree__nodes")
    .selectAll("circle.tree__node")
    .data(root.descendants())
    .enter()
    .append("g");
```

# Selections

First, you need to `select` HTML or SVG elements on the page - D3 works with both HTML _and_ SVG - using [CSS selector syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_Selector):
* `select` selects 1 element,
* `selectAll` selects all elements that match the selector

```
d3.select("body").style("background-color", "black");   // selects just the <body>, and makes it black
d3.selectAll(".paragraph").style("color", "blue");      // selects all .paragraph's, and makes them all have blue text
```

Normally, you'll want to join your elements with some data afterwards:

# Data joins

You then [attach/bind some data to your elements](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/v1.4.1/README.md#joining-data) after you've selected them - the data must always be an array.
For example, this selects all the circles, then sets their radiuses to be each score:
```
<circle r="40" cx="100 />
<circle r="40" cx="120" />

const scores = [
    {
        "name": "Andy",
        "score": 25
    },
    {
      "name": "Beth",
     "score": 39
    }
];

d3.selectAll('circle')
    .data(scores)
    .attr(
        'r', 
        function(d, i) {
            return d.score;
        }
    );
```
`d3.attr()` sets an attribute on each `circle`, here the radius.

The function here is called once for each element in `scores`, and implicitly passes in each `score` object, and its index - 0 to 5 here.

When D3 joins data to elements, it adds a `_data_` attribute to each DOM element with the joined data.

### Joining 1 thing
You can also join a single thing (like 1 objet by itself), with `.datum()`:
```
const featureCollection = {type: 'FeatureCollection', features: features};
d3.select('path#my-map')
    .datum(featureCollection);
```

### If the data's not exactly the right length?

The previous examples assume that your data is exactly the right length to fit whatever DOM elements you already have on the page - if there aren't enough (e.g. if there aren't _any_), or there are too many, matching your [selection](#selections), you'll need to use [enter() or exit()](#enterexit)


# Enter/exit

If there aren't enough DOM elements matching [selection](#selections) (e.g. if there aren't _any_), or there are too many, you need to use D3's [enter()](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/v1.4.1/README.md#selection_enter) or [exit()](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/v1.4.1/README.md#selection_exit) methods.

## Enter()

`d3.enter()` returns placeholder nodes for each DOM element in a [selection](#selections) after [joining data](#data_joins) to the selection, filling in any missing ones - so, if there were 5 things in the data array, but no DOM elements matching the selection, it'll create 5 dummy nodes, if there's 1 element it'll make 4 nodes, etc.
 What it returns is called the "enter selection" - you can also think of it as placeholder nodes for each datum that had no corresponding DOM element in the selection.

After entering, you'll normally want to call `d3.append()` to actually append the new nodes to the page; `enter()` _doesn't actually create new elements by itself_.

This will add 6 new DIVs to the body:
```
const div = d3.select("body")
    .selectAll("div")
    .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
    .enter()
    .append("div")
    .text(d => d);
    
// result:
<div>4</div>
<div>8</div>
<div>15</div>
<div>16</div>
<div>23</div>
<div>42</div>
```

## Exit()

Similarly, `exit()` and `remove()` do the reverse:
`exit()` returns the "exit selection", the DOM elements that need to be removed for the earlier selection to match the data - you can also think of it as DOM elements which don't have a matching thing in the data.

Taking the same DOM elements as above,
```
const div = d3.select("body")
  .selectAll("div")
  .data([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32], d => d);
```

> Since a key function was specified (as the identity function), and the new data contains the numbers \[4, 8, 16\] which match existing elements in the document, the update selection contains three DIV elements. Leaving those elements as-is, we can append new elements for \[1, 2, 32\] using the enter selection:

```
div.enter().append("div").text(d => d);

// to remove the exiting elements [15, 23, 42]:
div.exit().remove();

// result:
<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
<div>4</div>
<div>8</div>
<div>16</div>
<div>32</div>
```

## order()
You might need to call `selection.order()` to [re-order data](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/v1.4.1/README.md#selection_order).

## merge()
`selection.merge(otherSelection)` [merges](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/v1.4.1/README.md#selection_merge) two different selections together

## join()
There's also the `selection.join()` method that's shorthand for calling `selection.enter`, `selection.exit`, `selection.append`, `selection.remove`, and `selection.order` - it appends, removes and reorders elements to match a previous `d3.data()`:
```
svg.selectAll("circle")
    .data(data)
    .join("circle")
        .attr("fill", "none")
        .attr("stroke", "black");
        
// is equivalent to
svg.selectAll("circle")
    .data(data)
    .join(
        enter => enter.append("circle"),
        update => update,
        exit => exit.remove()
    )
        .attr("fill", "none")
        .attr("stroke", "black");
```

# Transformations
See the [API reference](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#modifying-elements). 
A lot of the time, you'll want to use
* `d3.attr()` to set an attribute on an element
* `d3.style()` to set a style
* `d3.classed()` to add or remove a class
* `d3.property()` to set a property, like `checked`
* `d3.text()` to set the text content 
* `d3.html()` to set the HTML content 

Each method returns the [selection](#selections) again, so you can chain them together:
```
d3.selectAll('circle')
    .data(myData)
    .attr('r', function(d, i) {
        return d;
    })
    .classed('high', function(d, i) {
        return d >= 40;
    })
    .attr('cx', function(d, i) {
     return i * 120;
    });
```

# Examples

## Simple bar chart
From [D3 in depth](https://www.d3indepth.com/datajoins/), 
```
const cities = [
  { name: 'London', population: 8674000},
  { name: 'New York', population: 8406000},
  { name: 'Sydney', population: 4293000},
  { name: 'Paris', population: 2244000},
  { name: 'Beijing', population: 11510000}
];

// Join cities to rect elements and modify height, width and position
d3.selectAll('rect')
    .data(cities)
    .attr('height', 19)
    .attr('width', function(d) {
        const scaleFactor = 0.00004;
        return d.population * scaleFactor;
    })
    .attr('y', function(d, i) {
        return i * 20;
    });

// Join cities to text elements and modify content and position
d3.selectAll('text')
    .data(cities)
    .attr('y', function(d, i) {
        return i * 20 + 13;
    })
    .attr('x', -4)
    .text(function(d) {
    return d.name;
    });
```
