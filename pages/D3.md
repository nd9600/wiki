[D3](https://d3js.org/) is a data visualisation library for HTML, SVGs, and CSS.

Generally, it works by:
1. [Selecting](#selections) DOM elements
2. [Joining data](#data_joins) to those elements
3. [Adding/removing](#enter_exit) elements from the page to match the data you've joined with
4. [Transforming](#transformations) the elements

Along with that, D3 also includes functions that let you easily
* [Scale](#scaling_inputs) input values to match some scale, useful when making axes
* [Make shapes](#making_shapes)
* [Layout data](#layouts) in more complicated ways
* [Interact](#interactions) with your data or elements
