* When non-witches stop using a term like "lame" because they think it's used offensively, is a moderating influence on the use of the term removed, so that in the future, only witches will use the term, in ways the non-witches think are offensive? i.e. when you change to a less offensive term, are you ceding the original term to people who will continue to use it offensively?
Does this mean you should continue using terms that have a possibility of being seen as offensive, explicitly with non-negative connotations - like continuing to say "gypsy" rather than "traveller"?

* Euphemism treadmill
* Altruism and whether or not you should tell people about charity: tell someone to feel good about yourself & it's not altruism, but, don't tell someone, you didn't tell someone so you're not showing how good a person you are, then feel good because of that. What to do? Tell someone so you don't fall into that trap? Does this just go round in circles? Is it a Byzantine Generals problem - can bitcoin save us?
* We can be too young to learn things, not like sex, maths teacher delays teaching, alice dreger talking to kid about sex in public
* "arrival", and death, whether things are "thought-provoking"

* I am unique vs I am like everyone else (explicit) vs everyone else is like me (typical mind, implicit)

* America is a state-nation, France and Estonia are nation-states

* Possibility spaces: reactions on Facebook and gmail's automatic suggestions constrain the possibility space of responses from human languages down to ~10 reactions, vs. the bitcoin.pdf opening up a giant possibility space that didn't exist before with Ethereum/Zcash etc., like functional programming does for programming
