## Attacks

### "Rapid change" for paleontologists means something competely different to an evolutionary biologist

### Since paleontologists only work with fossils, they can only see the evolution of morphology
They miss everything apart from bones/skeletons

### What's the mechanism for macro-evolutionary changes?

# Macro-evolution

## Introns

## Exons

## Splicing enzymes

## Non-coding DNA

## Transcription factors
Environmental regulation of when genes are activate
Change the context that proteins function in, when genes are expressing: if "x" is happening outside a cell, then activate this gene

### Promoters

### Repressors

## Access of transcription factors to DNA
Permanently change whether transcription factors can act
Chromatids

## Examples
### Splicing enzyme mutations
Imagine you have a gene coded for by 3 [exons](#exons) A B C, and messenger RNA that includes all of them + the [introns](#introns).
A splicing enzyme comes along and removes the introns and exons, forming the mature protein.

What if the splicing enzyme mutates?
Say it takes all of A and half of B and makes a protein, and takes the 2nd half of B and C, and makes another protein - you get 2 completely new proteins that didn't exist beforehand - a massive change, not a protein working slightly better or slightly worse.

A gene must code for the splicing enzyme, that gene has its own promoters, exons, slicing enzyme, .., so there can be recursive regulation - 1 splicing factor can have a big consequence.

### Promoter mutations
If a promoter mutates, it'll interact with a different transcription factor.
Since multiple copies of promoters appear upstream of multiple genes, 1 promoter can mediate the expression of entire protein networks.
If a promoter mutates, it can change an entire protein network. If it changes in only some of the places, it can make a new novel network, maybe half of the original proteins.
If it mutates everywhere, maybe it interacts with a completely different transcription factor, making a new if-then clause - if x happens, make a new network of proteins.
Effects amplify - not "a protein is 1% better at binding this hormone", far bigger.

#### Vole vasopressin promoter mutation
There's a promoter upstream of the vasopressin hormone - it does something with social-affiliative behaviour in males; since it's a hormone, there's a vasopressin receptor, so there's a vasopressin receptor gene, and a promoter upstram of that gene. It can come in a few different versions.

There are lots of different vole species - mountains, plains, wherever, some are monogamous, some polygamous - monogamous voles have a different promoter upstream of the vasopressin receptor gene compared to the polygamous voles.
If you change the promoter with gene therapy, you can make a polygamous vole into a monogamous one.
Change a protein -> different expression pattern (what part of the brain it winds up in etc) -> major shift in behaviour

Recent studies have shown for human males, which version of that promoter you have gives you some predictive power of how stable your social relationships will be (more/less likely to get divorced etc).

#### Gene that codes for dynorphin
Dynorphin is hormone neurotransmitter that has something to do with pain perception, related to morphine.
It has a gene and a promoter - recent research has shown the more copies of that promotoer (IN RATS) predicts how readily they get addicted to some drugs
