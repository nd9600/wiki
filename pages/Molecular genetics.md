## Attacks

### "Rapid change" for paleontologists means something competely different to an evolutionary biologist

### Since paleontologists only work with fossils, they can only see the evolution of morphology
They miss everything apart from bones/skeletons

### What's the mechanism for macro-evolutionary changes?

# Macro-evolution

## Introns

## Exons

## Splicing enzymes

## Non-coding DNA

## Transcription factors
Environmental regulation of when genes are activate
Change the context that proteins function in, when genes are expressing: if "x" is happening outside a cell, then activate this gene

### Promoters

### Repressors

## Access of transcription factors to DNA
Permanently change whether transcription factors can act
Chromatids

## Examples
### Splicing enzyme mutations
Imagine you have a gene coded for by 3 [exons](#exons) A B C, and messenger RNA that includes all of them + the [introns](#introns).
A splicing enzyme comes along and removes the introns and exons, forming the mature protein.

What if the splicing enzyme mutates?
Say it takes all of A and half of B and makes a protein, and takes the 2nd half of B and C, and makes another protein - you get 2 completely new proteins that didn't exist beforehand - a massive change, not a protein working slightly better or slightly worse.

A gene must code for the splicing enzyme, that gene has its own promoters, exons, slicing enzyme, .., so there can be recursive regulation - 1 splicing factor can have a big consequence.

### Promoter mutations
If a promoter mutates, it'll interact with a different transcription factor.
Since multiple copies of promoters appear upstream of multiple genes, 1 promoter can mediate the expression of entire protein networks.
If a promoter mutates, it can change an entire protein network. If it changes in only some of the places, it can make a new novel network, maybe half of the original proteins.
If it mutates everywhere, maybe it interacts with a completely different transcription factor, making a new if-then clause - if x happens, make a new network of proteins.
Effects amplify - not "a protein is 1% better at binding this hormone", far bigger.

#### Vole vasopressin promoter mutation
There's a promoter upstream of the vasopressin hormone - it does something with social-affiliative behaviour in males; since it's a hormone, there's a vasopressin receptor, so there's a vasopressin receptor gene, and a promoter upstram of that gene. It can come in a few different versions.

There are lots of different vole species - mountains, plains, wherever, some are monogamous, some polygamous - monogamous voles have a different promoter upstream of the vasopressin receptor gene compared to the polygamous voles.
If you change the promoter with gene therapy, you can make a polygamous vole into a monogamous one.
Change a protein -> different expression pattern (what part of the brain it winds up in etc) -> major shift in behaviour

Recent studies have shown for human males, which version of that promoter you have gives you some predictive power of how stable your social relationships will be (more/less likely to get divorced etc).

#### Gene that codes for dynorphin
Dynorphin is hormone neurotransmitter that has something to do with pain perception, related to morphine.
It has a gene and a promoter - recent research has shown the more copies of that promotoer (IN RATS) predicts how readily they get addicted to some drugs

### Mutation in gene for a transcription factor
You'll get massive changes in protein networks.

If you compare the human genome to the chimp genome - what are 2% of differences?
Disproportionate share are genes that code for transcription factors - that makes sense: if you get a change in a gene for a structural protein, maybe your muscles bend a little bit one way rather than another; if a gene for a transcription factor changes, you'll have loads of new novel networks.

This was big support for King and Wilson from Berkeley, who came up with the "98%", and predicted that the most interesting changes in DNA will be in the regulatory parts, not the coding parts - eeverything since has supported that.

### Genome size vs % transcription factors

Over 100 genomes sequenced - if you line them up from short of long genomes, the more genes a species have, the higher % of genes are transcription factors:
If you have 1 gene, you only need 1 transcription factor
1 gene    1 transcription factor
2         3 TF lets you get the max information out of them - you transcribe A, or B, or AB
3         7
4         15
5         31
n         2^n - 1

There's an exponential increase in the # of TFs you need to take advantage of all the possible combinations of networks of gene expression.
Little changes in genes that code for TFs, splicing enzymes, promoters -> big consequences

## Transposons - jumping genes
Barbara McClintock was a plant biologist, very successful, at 40 a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
One day she made a discovery that destroyed her career - molecular biology didn't exist then, all you could do to make sense of inheritance is to look at the phenotype, see if peas or people are wrinkly or not, the colours of corn kernels.
She sees a pattern of inheritance that keeps popping up - the only way for her to explain it was if genes were moving around in the DNA, so she proposed there were transposable genes - transposons, people derisively called them "jumping genes".
People laughed at her, so she disappeared to her corn field, working alone for decades, ignored.

In the 1980s, molecular techniques caught up and showed she was right.

Transposons - transposable genetic elements: genes pick up and move around.
They wouldn't have been discovered if McClintock was studying sperm whales, only in plants:
If you're an animal, you can run/crawl/fly away if things get stuff.
Plants can't move, they need a more subtle, fancier, mechanism - plant, in stress responses to a challenge, move genes around in the hopes of finding something novel/useful to get them out of trouble.
They activate transposase, an enzyme, to start transposing genes.

Animals have them too - where they were first discovered makes sense too.
You're a scientist inventing a never seen before pathogen, you inject it into people, they get sick, 2 months later they've been antibodies against it, even though it's never existed before.
How does the immune system make antibodies to fight something it's never seen before? One of the tricks is splicing genes that are relevant to making antibodies, inducable transposable events, then filtering them to see if they're good against novel pathogens.

Pathogens also do it - trypanosomes cause trypanosomiasis, and take away their surface proteins, juggle their DNA a bit, so your antibodies can't recognise them anymore.

### In primates
There's a transposable element that's predominant in primates which is most mobile when brain cells that make new neurons (neural progenitor cells), at the time they start proliferating: you get novel things neurons can do, the cells in your body that have the most to do with who you are are the least constrained by genetics - right when they're first being made, their genes are getting shuffled more than anywhere else
