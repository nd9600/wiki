## Attacks

### "Rapid change for paleontologists means something competely different to an evolutionary biologist

### Since paleontologists only work with fossils, they can only see the evolution of morphology
They miss everything apart from bones/skeletons

### What's the mechanism for macro-evolutionary changes?

# Macro-evolution

## Introns

## Exons

## Splicing enzymes

## Non-coding DNA

## Transcription factors
Environmental regulation of when genes are activate
Change the context that proteins function in, when genes are expressing: if "x" is happening outside a cell, then activate this gene

### Promoters

### Repressors

## Access of transcription factors to DNA
Permanently change whether transcription factors can act
Chromatids

## Example

Imagine you have a gene coded for by 3 [exons](#exons) A B C, and messenger RNA that includes all of them + the [introns](#introns).
A splicing enzyme comes along and removes the introns and exons, forming the mature protein.

What if the splicing enzyme mutates?
Say it takes all of A and half of B and makes a protein, and takes the 2nd half of B and C, and makes another protein - you get 2 completely new proteins that didn't exist beforehand - a massive change, not a protein working slightly better or slightly worse.
