# The central dogma

DNA -> RNA -> proteins -> life

# Micro-mutations

# Gradualism

# Punctuated equilibrium
Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge

## Attacks

### "Rapid change for paleontologists means something competely different to an evolutionary biologist

### Since paleontologists only work with fossils, they can only see the evolution of morphology
They miss everything apart from bones/skeletons

### What's the mechanism for macro-evolutionary changes?

# Macro-evolution

## Introns

## Extrons

## Splicing enzymes

## Non-coding DNA

## Transcription factors
Environmental regulation of when genes are activate
Change the context that proteins function in, when genes are expressing: if "x" is happening outside a cell, then activate this gene

### Promoters

### Repressors

## Access of transcription factors to DNA
Permanently change whether transcription factors can act
Chromatids
