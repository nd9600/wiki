You need to make a frame out of wood, put gyprock on it, then tiles on the gyprock.

# Making the frame
![The frame](static/images/joinery_frame.jpg)
Say the frame is 1700x800mm
* Use treated wood if it's going outside, untreated is fine otherwise

* After cutting the first length, but the second one beside it, mark the first one at the same length, and cut it - you don't need to measure it
    * Make a small cut at the mark by pulling the saw backwards **only**, so the saw doesn't slip out of where you're cutting
    * Measure twice, cut once
* Get the width of the wood (\~45mm), mark that long from the end, divide into 4 even squares, then mark with X's half-way to the sides of the beam - this is so you can put screws in at the X's
* Pilot drill holes for screws so they're easier to screw in - drill them all the way in
* Then use a countersink to make an indent so the screw is flush with the wood
* Put the short beam at the end of the long one, lined up with the screw holes
* Screw in 4 3-inch screws
    * Do it a little bit at a time, don't push too much
    * Push a little bit on the end of the drill to get the screw in
    * Make sure the drill's the same orientation as the screw
    * You can make the drill go into reverse to get the screw out, and try again
    * The drill bit should be slightly bigger than the screw if it's gripping, smaller otherwise
    * Sometimes you need to make the drill longer if the screw doesn't go the whole way through the wood
* Screw in both short beams to one of the long beams first
* You'll need a middle beam, \~800mm long
* Mark 600mm down - where the bottom of the middle bit goes
* Mark 4 squares above the 600mm line, like before

# Putting gyprock on the frame
![The frame with the gyprock](static/images/joinery_frameWithGyprock.jpg)
It has a tapered edge, so when you join 2 pieces together, it looks like 1 continuous piece
* Cut at 1200mm with a stanley knife - it's easier if you cut against a long beam
    * Pull the knife against the beam so it doesn't slip the wrong direction
* Cut that piece at 600mm
* Cut _that_ piece at 890mm - the width of the frame + 2 \* the width of the beam
* Drywall screws are a bit smaller than normal ones
* Screw in in the corners and middle, a bit, so that the screws are stuck in the gyprock
* Put the frame in a vice, screw gyprock in - make sure the screw heads are past the gyprock, it needs to be flat
* Put more screws in until it's secure

# Putting things in the gyprock
## Socket box
* Put the closed end against the gyprock, make sure it's not against the frame
* Draw a box round it **tightly**
* Hammer a hole in the center of the box, then paddle saw from the hole to the corners, then round the rectangle - it's better to stay inside the lines, you can sand off extra bits, but you can't get pieces you've removed back
* Rasp edges if you need to
* Push the yellow sides of the box in, push the box in, then pull the yellow bits back, so they're behind the gyprock

## Repairing holes
* Mark a box round the hole, like with the socket box - use a spirit level
* Cut with a paddle saw and rasp, like before
* Cut another piece of gyprock that's the same size as the hole - it should be slightly bigger, you can rasp it
* Cut a length of wood a bit longer than the hole
* Put drywall screws on each side of the hole like before
* Put the wood behind the hole, then screw the screws in
* Push the extra piece in the hole, screw more screws into the wood
* You won't see the repair once it's filled in and sanded properly

# Tiling
![The first row of the tiles](static/images/joinery_firstTileRow.jpg)
* You need a strap of wood at the bottom for the tiles to sit on
* Cut it, put screws in the wood a bit - make sure they'll go into the wood & won't hit the screws you've already put in the frame
* Screw in against the gyprock, make sure the wood's level
* Measure a tile to work out the gauge, and mark the lengths against a gauge rod (can be just another beam)
* 'Tile' the tiles (like a desktop background) against the gyprock, leaving 2mm between them for spacers
* If the tiles leave a big bit on one side not covered (a cut), find the middle of the wall and tile from the inside out, so you'll leave an even cut on each side (if you're tiling a floor, imagine it's a square)
* Run silicon round the corners of walls - you don't need the anti-mold one, it doesn't work
* Use flexible adhesive on wooden floors - joints will crack with movement on the floor otherwise
* use ordinary adhesive on walls
* use waterproof adhesive in a kitchen/bathroom
* powdered adhesive's better for grout
* When putting a bath in, seal it first, half-fill the bath with water, and let it sit for a day, _then_ tile
* Double seal to stop leaks

* Put grout on the wall or the tile - hard to do it on brick walls, tiles are easier
* Push tiles hard against the grout, aligned with the lines you drew earlier
* Put spacers between 2 tiles
* If a tile's below another one, put a spacer between them
* Wipe every 3/4 tiles with a wet sponge
* Squeeze tiles flat so they're a flat surface - check with a spirit level
* Bob Marley died in 1981
* Wash the grout trowel with a wet sponge, **not** in the sink - it'll dry out and clog the sink - then throw the water in the bin
