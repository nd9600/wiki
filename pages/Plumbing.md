Every other time I've been on a course, it's either been to learn so I can eventually pass an exam, or for work; this was the first time I've gone on one just for myself, with no pressure.

# Day 1
Bill's Tool shop in the Barras sells good tools for cheaper than big stores, can get everything for Â£90.
Plumbers use ball-peen hammers, not the ones that joiners ues to pull out nails.
Hack saws:
* make sure the arrows point forward so you can cut properly
* let saws do the work
* use the whole blade, not just a small bit of it

They use grips to hold things, and shifters, not spanners, because shifters adjust

Lead pipes are poisonous, copper is expensive but looks better, so people use cheaper plastic (it's flexible), but it hangs down and doesn't go straight

Use ratchet pipe cutters for plastic pipes
Metal pipe slicers for metal pipes, push the pipe in until it clicks, then turn in the direction of the arrow

Use box-key (just a chunk of metal) to turn nuts in hard to reach sinks, but really you should use a crawfit
Rulers are more accurate than tape measures - they're always 2mm out

Pipes can be 15 or 22mm wide - bigger pipe means higher flow-rate
15mm used for radiators - it's cheaper, and the circuit is smaller so you don't care about the flow rate as much, and the pressure is already high
22mm used underfloor and in baths cos you want a high flow rate
If water takes too long to get where it's going, it cools down
Higher flow rate -> faster -> hotter water
Dropping water from a bucket 10m up is equivalent to 1 bar of pressure, typical house pressure is 1 to 3 bar, this is why old ones have tanks in the roof, gravity does the work, because they didn't have pumps
Rehau is a new material for pipes, 100 year guarantee it doesn't leak - expands to fit fittings, you don't fit fittings onto the pipe, but it's only used for heating right now, hasn't been approved for drinking water
