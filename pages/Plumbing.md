Every other time I've been on a course, it's either been to learn so I can eventually pass an exam, or for work; this was the first time I've gone on one just for myself, with no pressure.

# Day 1
Bill's Tool shop in the Barras sells good tools for cheaper than big stores, can get everything for £90.

## Tools
Plumbers use ball-peen hammers, not the ones that joiners ues to pull out nails.
Hack saws:
* make sure the arrows point forward so you can cut properly
* let saws do the work
* use the whole blade, not just a small bit of it

They use grips to hold things, and shifters, not spanners, because shifters adjust

Lead pipes are poisonous, copper is expensive but looks better, so people use cheaper plastic (it's flexible), but it hangs down and doesn't go straight

Use ratchet pipe cutters for plastic pipes
Metal pipe slicers for metal pipes, push the pipe in until it clicks, then turn in the direction of the arrow

Use box-key (just a chunk of metal) to turn nuts in hard to reach sinks, but really you should use a crawfit
Rulers are more accurate than tape measures - they're always 2mm out

## Stopcock/valve
* turns off water to the whole property
* near where the (outside) riser is when the building was made (if it's a flat), could be anywhere, but generally in the kitchen, under the sink cos that's where the water goes first
* kitchen water first to get drinkable water, direct from the mains
* other water (e.g. bathroom sinks) used to be from cold tanks in the attic, and if a rat dies in it, you won't notice the blood for 4 weeks. why you should drink water from the kitchen sink if you're worried about it
* when pressure is > 1 bar, you would use an up-and-over valve to reduce the pressure - water goes into the valve, hits a wall, and has to go up and over it, reducing the pressure. This is to stop contamination by stopping backpressure - when the pressure is too high from the taps, it can flow backwards into the tanks/pipes - this makes water only flow forward, to the taps
* in older properties, with lower pressure, gate valves are used, so they don't reduce the pressure when used, aka straight through valve

## Radiators
* Thermostatic radiator valves, TRVs
* TRV works with combi and system boilers
* higher numbers -> increase flow rate -> more heat
* cap unscrews and pops off
* only costs ~£3
* never set them to 0 if you have a frost setting, use it - it senses when the water inside the pipe is 2 degrees, and they turn the valve up to 5 internally, so they actually tell the boiler to send more water -> more heat, stops the pipes freezing

## Pipes 
Can be 15 or 22mm wide - bigger pipe means higher flow-rate
15mm used for radiators - it's cheaper, and the circuit is smaller so you don't care about the flow rate as much, and the pressure is already high
22mm used underfloor and in baths cos you want a high flow rate
If water takes too long to get where it's going, it cools down
Higher flow rate -> faster -> hotter water
Dropping water from a bucket 10m up is equivalent to 1 bar of pressure, typical house pressure is 1 to 3 bar, this is why old ones have tanks in the roof, gravity does the work, because they didn't have pumps
Rehau is a new material for pipes, 100 year guarantee it doesn't leak - expands to fit fittings, you don't fit fittings onto the pipe, but it's only used for heating right now, hasn't been approved for drinking water

## Fittings
* Can be copper, plastic, or low-carbon steel
* Low-carbon steel fittings used when you don't want to use copper (it gets stolen), as it's stronger, so it's used in schools so if kids kick the radiators, it won't break
* Solder ring fitting (aka Yorkshire/yorkie) made of copper, expands inside when heated to seal against the pipe - solder melts and runs, permanently attaches pipe and fitting
* End feed fittings don't have solder, you have to solder them yourselves
* Compression fittings, compress against olives (little copper rings)
* Straight-union fittings
* Elbow fittings (L-shaped) have locks - to unlock it, unscrew it slightly and push in from end to remove the teeth that push against a plate, releasing it

## How to attach pipes together
* People generally have 3m sections of pipe, so you need to join them if you have more than 3m to run
* Clean inside and out of the pipes with steel wool first
* To use ratchet pipe cutters for plastic pipes

### Copper fittings, heating
* Put flux on the end of the pipes to clean it
    * always goes on the pipe, not on the fitting
    * pick one side to heat, mainly. Heat 50% rib, 50% pipe - so the solder runs around, but the pipe conducts heat, so the other side warms up too

#### Blowtorch
* hold in right hand
* turn the wheel on the back slightly, then click the button on the front, then the one on the top, so you don't need to hold the front button
* to turn off, click the front button again
* it's a low enough temperature when someone can hear you speak over it - cone at the bottom should connect (I think?)
* is done when you can see some solder run out of the pipe
* use the middle of the flame, not the top or bottom
* make sure the pipe is cool before you lift it, then run water over it to cool it down more (can be hot or cold - use grips to hold it)

#### No solder in the pipe
* if there isn't any solder in the pipes, you need to solder it yourself
* make sure there's enough heat, so the solder doesn't stick to the pipe/blowtorch
* hold in left hand, solder in right (needs more control)
* put flux on the end of the solder first (stops the solder sticking), then heat the pipe, *then* put the solder in
* heat first side for ~10s, then the other for ~3s (pipe conducts heat)
* make sure there's no "snotter" - don't use too much solder, put no more solder on the yorky

* copper pipes might need insulation, since they lose more heat than plastic, but it looks better than plastic

### Compression fittings
Put one nut on the middle of the pipe, then the olive, then the other end, flip the pipe round so the olive slides under the second end, then move the nut down, and screw it on. Hold the middle of the fitting (the low bit) in your left-hand with the grip, and the nut in your right with the shifter. Move them together until the nut's tight
 
Plumbers make a lot of money - if a tap washer gets worn on one side, you can just take it off, turn it round, and put it back on - saves you £110
